*                       Your computer is your universe.    
*
*                               by Téo Taylor
* 
* Visit https://teojt.github.io/timeway.html for more info on Timeway.
* 
* Here's the basics of Timeway's code:
* Timeway is split into "screens", which you can think of as mini-apps.
* The most significant of them all is the Pixel Realm (where all the 3D file 
* stuff is). There is also the Editor, and other miscellaneous screens in
* otherscreens.pde. 
* 
* Screens have their own states and variables which are cleared when the screen is
* no longer in use. All screens use Timeway's engine, which stores the entire 
* application's state and provides shared functions for all screens to access 
* (e.g. file management, sounds, displaying).
* 
* 
* Here's a quick rundown of what the other .pde files contain:
*
* pixelrealm_ui: Simply adds UI functionality to the base PixelRealm class since
* having it all in one class would make it bloated and extremely difficult to 
* maintain.
*
* screen_startup: Screen that shows the Timeway logo and loading screen and does a 
* few startup stuff.
*
* zAndroid and zDesktop: Timeway is designed to work on both Desktop and Android using
* the same codebase. However, there are obviously some big differences between the two,
* and libraries that exist in Android mode simply don't exist for Java (desktop) mode
* and vice verca.
* The solution? Have two scripts for each version.
* When you switch to Android mode, uncomment all the code in zAndroid and comment zDeskstop.
* When you switch to Java mode, uncomment all the code in zDesktop and comment zAndroid.
* Probably the worst system ever, but we like to keep it simple instead of spending ages
* looking for another solution.
*
* Anyways, I have no idea who's reading this or who would delve into the code of Timeway,
* but if you're here reading this, then have fun!
